# Welcome to the ImagePlayground Project 
The Project was a summer project with 2 milestones aimed to rampup gradually on C++ and OpenCv

# Objectives:
* Expand and develop your C++ skills
* Improve Design, Estimation & Coding skills
* Ramp up and use industry standard libraries in Software Image.

## The vision of the project
The project deliverable will be a working system which will
* Receive an input folder of images 
* Detect some characteristics of the images.
* Apply changes / modifications to a copy of the images
* Output the results and a summary to the output folder

## Technical Skils 
 * Develop and Run in Linux environment
 * Utilize C++ latest capabilities wherever possible
 * Learn to Use OpenCV
 
 ### Milestone 1 (Done):

 * Apply a colored bounding box to the shape.

### Milestone 2 (Done):

 * Add capability of Face detection
 * Add a blur to the face
 
### Milestone 3 (for the future):
