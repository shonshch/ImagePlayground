# Welcome to the ImagePlayground Project 
This is a Students Rampup Project at Flex GEAR Jer. 
The Project was an Agile Project with the 3 milestones aimed to rampup gradually on C++, OpenCV and Intel Nervana AI.
We hand (weekly) standups, code reviews, pseudo git-flow and unit tests.

# Objectives:
* Experience a flex project Model-of-Work, with agile team work, tools and progress.
* Expand and develop your C++ skills
* Improve Design, Estimation & Coding skills
* Ramp up and use industry standard libraries in Software Image and AI

## High Level Requirements
The project deliverable will be a working system which will
* Receive an input folder of images 
* Detect some characteristics of the images.
* Apply changes / modifications to a copy of the images
* Output the results and a summary to the output folder

## Technical Requirements
 * Develop and Run in Linux environment
 * Utilize C++ latest capabilities wherever possible
 * Learn and Use OpenCV & Intel Nervana
 
 ### Milestone 1 (Done): 

 * Detect shapes - Circles, Squares & Rectangles.
 * Apply a colored bounding box to the shape.

### Milestone 2 (Done):

 * Add capability of Face detection
 * Add a blur to the face
 
### Milestone 3:

 * Detect multiple faces in image using Nervana neon model (from ModelZoo)
 * Replace people's faces with the faces of the Simpsons



# Updates
## Feburary 2018 Update:

  Milestone #1 merged to Dev branch on Feb 7th.

## April 2018 Update:

  Milestone #2 merged to Dev branch on April 15th. 
  Project offically closed. Open for later contribution and AI rampup in the future.

### Project Retrospective 

What works:
 - Gained experience with Git, C++, OpenCV,
 - Code reviews, Unit tests was beneficial
 - Good "project experience" - stand-ups, code reviews, etc
 - Great delivery - good and fast

What can get better: 
 - More emphasis on technical excellence (Clean Code) 
 - The process & tools ramp-up is more important than the task itself (opinion)
 - Better customize tasks to the individual student and his previous skills. 
 - Define tasks better and quicker - to avoid time waste
